## Motivations for the Workshop

Since the appearance of transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), **Deep Learning** (DL) and neural approaches 
have brought a huge contribution to Natural Language Processing (NLP) either with highly specialized
models for specific application or via Large Language Models (LLMs) (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023) that
are efficient few-shot learners for many NLP tasks.
Such models usually build on huge web-scale data
(raw multilingual corpora and annotated specialized, task related, corpora) that are now widely
available on the Web. This approach has clearly
shown many successes, but still suffers from several weaknesses, such as the cost/impact of training
on raw data, biases, hallucinations, explainability,
among others (Nah et al., 2023).

The **Linguistic Linked Open Data** (LLOD)
(Chiarcos et al., 2013) community aims at creating/distributing explicitly structured data (modelled
as RDF graphs) and interlinking such data across
languages. This collection of datasets, gathered
inside the LLOD Cloud (Chiarcos et al., 2020),
contains a huge amount of multilingual ontological (e.g. DBpedia (Lehmann et al., 2015)); lexical
(e.g., DBnary (Sérasset, 2015), Wordnet (McCrae
et al., 2014), Wikidata (Vrandečić and Krötzsch,
2014)); or linguistic (e.g., Universal Dependencies
Treebank (Nivre et al., 2020; Chiarcos et al., 2021),
DBpedia Abstract Corpus (Brümmer et al., 2016))
information, structured using common metadata
(e.g., OntoLex (McCrae et al., 2017), NIF (Hellmann et al., 2013), etc.) and standardised data cat-
egories (e.g., lexinfo (Cimiano et al., 2011), OliA
(Chiarcos and Sukhareva, 2015)).

Both communities bring striking contributions
that seem to be highly complementary. However, if
knowledge (ontological) graphs are now routinely
used in DL, there is still very few research studying
the value of Linguistic/Lexical knowledge in the
context of DL. We think that, today, there is a real
opportunity to bring both communities together to
take the best of both worlds. Indeed, with more and
more work on Graph Neural Networks (Wu et al., 2023) and 
Embeddings on RDF graphs (Ristoski et al., 2019), there is more and more opportunity to
apply DL techniques to build, interlink or enhance
Linguistic Linked Open Datasets, to borrow data
from the LLOD Cloud for enhancing Neural Models on NLP tasks, or to take the best of both worlds
for specific NLP use cases.

## Submission Topics

This workshop aims at gathering researchers that
work on the interaction between DL and LLOD in
order to discuss what each approach has to bring
to the other. For this, we welcome contributions
on original work involving some of the following (non exhaustive)
topics:

- Deep Learning for Linguistic Linked Data,
among which (but not exclusively):
  - Modelling, Resources & Interlinking,
  - Relation Extraction
  - Corpus annotation
  - Ontology localization
  - Knowledge/Linguistic Graphs creation or expansion
- Linguistic Linked Data for Deep Learning,
among which (but not exclusively):
  - Linguistic/Knowledge Graphs as training
data
  - Fine tuning LLMs using Linguistic
Linked (meta)Data
  - Graph Neural Networks
  - Knowledge/Linguistic Graphs embeddings
  - LLOD for model explainability/sourcing
  - Neural models for under-resourced languages
- Joint Deep Learning and Linguistic Data applications
  - Use cases combining Language Models and Structured Linguistic Data
  - LLOD and DL for Digital Humanities
  - Question-Answering on graph data

All application domains (Digital Humanities,
FinTech, Education, Linguistics, Cybersecurity...)
as well as approaches (NLG, NLU, Data Extraction...) are welcome, provided that the work is
based on the use of BOTH Deep Learning techniques and Linguistic Linked (meta)Data.
